user restarting and inputting a new destination 

As a user, when I want to input a new destination, I don't want to log out and log back in to restart the process. 
Instead, I would like a button that allows me to return home and prompts me to enter the starting location and destination 
again, so that I can use the application seamlessly. This functionality should be available after I receive the Spotify
playlists and lists of recommended songs.
