user log in

    As a user, when I visit the website I will be prompted to log in user my Spotfy account. Clicking on the log-in
    button will redirect me to the Spotify authentication page, where I can log in with my Spotify credentials. If I
    am already logged into Spotify on my device, the info may autofill. Once my Spotify authentication is completed
    I will be brought back to the site. 

    If there are any issues with logging in, such as authorization issues or incorrect credentials, proper error
    messages and prompts will be displayed.
